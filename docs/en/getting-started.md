# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up Xrypton and sending your first encrypted message.

## Set Up Your Account

To use Xrypton, you first need to set up an account.
Here's how to get started.

### Accessing a Xrypton Server

First, access the Xrypton server you want to join.
Once the Xrypton landing page is displayed, click "Get Started" to proceed to the registration screen.

### Key Generation

On the registration screen, you will first be asked to generate your keys.
These keys are used to verify that what you send truly comes from you, and to allow others to send you encrypted messages.

- **User ID** : This identifies you across the entire Xrypton network. Choose carefully. If the same name is already registered, you will not be able to register.
- **Main Passphrase** : Used to encrypt your main private key. You won't use this often, but it is important, so store it in a safe place.
- **Sub Passphrase** : Used to encrypt your sub private key. This is the key you'll use day-to-day. You can have your browser remember this passphrase.

> **Important** : Secret key and passphrases are never sent to the server. If you lose them, your account cannot be recovered. Be sure to store them in a safe place.

You can also [set up a custom domain](/docs/en/custom-domain) for your User ID.

After confirming your passphrases, you're all set.

### Setting Up WebAuthn

All critical operations require authentication using WebAuthn.
Register it with your browser so that you can perform important operations.

### Server Registration

If "Registration Complete" is displayed here, your account has been successfully registered on the server.

Be sure to click the "Export Private Keys" button shown below, and store the displayed private keys in a safe place.
If you lose these keys, your account cannot be recovered.
You can export them again after logging in, but make sure to export and store them safely at this point.

Click the "Continue" button and you're ready to go!

## Edit Profile

Setting up your profile is important so that others can recognize you.

To set up your profile, click the round icon in the upper right corner.
Click the "Edit Profile" button to start editing your profile.
Click the icon to upload your favorite image, and write your display name and bio.

Your profile is signed with your key, so others can verify that the profile was written by you.

## Start Chatting

After registering, you'll see an empty chat screen.
This is where you chat. From left to right, you'll see spaces for "Channels", "Threads", and "Messages".
Choose members in a channel, select a thread, and start chatting.

### Use Self-Chat as a Notepad

Let's start by opening a chat with yourself and using it as a notepad.

Click the + button in the upper right of the channel list, and press OK without entering anything.
A chat with your own name will appear. Select it, then click "General" in the thread list.

In the message area, type a message at the bottom and send it using the send button on the right.

Your secure notepad is now ready.

### Chat with Others

First, add the person you want to chat with to your contacts.

1. Click the contacts tab at the bottom of the screen.

1. In the window that opens, enter the User ID of the person you want to chat with.
