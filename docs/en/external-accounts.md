# External Account Integration

Xrypton supports integration with external accounts as a way for Xrypton users to prove ownership of those external accounts.

## Bluesky (AT Protocol) Integration

By posting public key information to Bluesky (which uses the AT Protocol) and signing the metadata of that post, you can prove that a Xrypton user owns that AT Protocol account.

For details, please read [AT Protocol Integration](/docs/en/atproto).

## X Integration

By posting public key information to X and signing the metadata of that post, you can prove that a Xrypton user owns that X account.

You can start this integration from the profile screen.
Start integration on the profile screen, post a message containing your public key information, get the URL of that post, and paste it into the Xrypton input field.
By signing this information and saving it on the server, you can prove ownership of the X account.
