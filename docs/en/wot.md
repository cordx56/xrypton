# Web of Trust

Xrypton provides a mechanism for building its own Web of Trust, where users sign each other's public keys to prove that those keys are trustworthy.

Building a Web of Trust relies on mutually trusted users signing each other's keys.
When you find someone you trust, sign each other's keys.

## Getting Your Key Signed by Others

To have another user sign your Xrypton public key, select "Show Web of Trust Code" from your profile to display a QR code.
Once the other user scans the QR code, verify the signature destination, User ID, and public key fingerprint displayed on their screen. If everything looks correct, have them sign your key.

Now you're part of the Web of Trust!

## Signing Another User's Key

To sign another user's public key, first open your contacts list and select the QR code button in the upper right.
A popup will appear to launch the QR code reader. Scan the QR code.
Verify that the other user's information and signature details are correct, and if everything looks good, select OK.

You've now invited the other user to the Web of Trust.

## Viewing the Trust Graph

When you interact with a new user, if that person is reachable within a few steps through users you trust, a chain of people who trust that person will be displayed on their profile screen.
By selecting this user list, you can view the signature relationships as a graph, showing which connections make that user trustworthy.
