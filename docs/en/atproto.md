# AT Protocol Integration

Xrypton can integrate with servers that use the AT Protocol and sign posts on the AT Protocol.

When you log in to your AT Protocol account from Xrypton, you will be asked to publish your public key information.
By publishing this post and saving a signature for that post on the server, external users can verify the relationship between your Xrypton account and your AT Protocol account.

## Connecting to the AT Protocol

To connect to the AT Protocol, select the globe tab at the bottom of the screen and enter your AT Protocol handle.
You will be redirected to an authentication screen. After authentication, when you return to Xrypton, you can view other people's posts and create your own posts.

When you create a new post yourself, each post is signed and the signature data is saved on the server.

When viewing posts on Xrypton, posts from people using the AT Protocol on the same Xrypton server are signature-verified, and a check mark is shown when verification succeeds.
